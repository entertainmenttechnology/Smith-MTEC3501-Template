# 🌱 MTEC 3501 – Speculative Reflection (Version 1)

**Due:** Week 2 (Remote Class & Brainstorming)  
**Format:** Shareable Google Doc, Dropbox link, or PDF (no GitHub upload yet)  
**Length:** ~1–2 pages or equivalent media + short oral framing  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This assignment is your **first reflection on a long-term project idea**.  

- Draw from your **own experiences, knowledge, passions, and inspirations** — no outside research yet.  
- Speculate **boldly and without limits of budget or time**. Imagine as if you had decades to bring this to life.  
- Keep it **grounded in possibility**: avoid ideas that break the laws of physics (e.g., time travel, perpetual motion).  
- Recognize that your **reflection is not binding**: your final project may grow from an unexpected fragment.  
- Frame your idea through **User Experience (UX)** so others can *imagine what it feels like*.  
- If you see it as a **team project**, include that in your framing.  
- Begin to surface **perceived difficulties and unanswered questions** — these will be explored in the next assignment.

## 🔍 Reflection Prompts
Answer the following (in text, visuals, or mixed media):

1. **Title & Concept Name** – Give your idea a working name.  
2. **Speculative Premise** – What future, system, or experience are you imagining?  
3. **Core Idea (in plain words)** – What is at the heart of your project?  
4. **Metaphor or Narrative** – A story, image, or analogy that frames your idea.  
5. **Speculative Qualities** – What makes it bold, emergent, or disruptive?  
6. **Personal Connection** – How does it connect to your experiences, knowledge, passions, or inspirations?  
7. **User Experience (UX) & Modality**  
   - What is the modality (gameplay, music, performance, installation, robot, etc.)?  
   - What does the participant actually *do*?  
   - What does the experience *feel like* from their perspective?  
8. **Team Potential** (optional) – Could this project be collaborative? If so, what roles might others play?  
9. **Challenges & Unknowns** – What parts feel difficult, unresolved, or uncertain? What questions remain open?  
10. **Long Arc Potential** – If it developed over years or decades, what could it become?

## 📦 Deliverable
Prepare a **shareable artifact** (~1–2 pages or equivalent) that communicates your idea and the user experience clearly. Possible formats include:  

- A short written reflection or outline  
- A concept sketch, diagram, or storyboard  
- A mood board or inspiration collage  
- A prior project you’re building on, with notes for its evolution  
- A short audio sketch, musical fragment, or video clip  
- Any hybrid mix of text + media  

👉 The **UX description and perceived difficulties** are essential: classmates should be able to *visualize the experience* and recognize its open questions.

## 🎤 Oral Presentation (Week 2 Brainstorming)
In class, you will **briefly describe your reflection aloud** (2–3 minutes).  
Focus on framing your **bold concept through the experience**:  

- What is the modality?  
- What does the participant *do*?  
- What does it *feel like* to encounter it?  
- What challenges or unanswered questions do you see?  
- If a team project: how might collaboration shape it?  

This is your chance to **lay down your marker** so classmates can respond.

## 🔄 Iterative Development Cycle
This reflection is the **first step** in a recursive cycle of development:  

**Speculation → Research → Design → Produce/Make → Present/Publish → Assess**  

- **Assignment 1 (this week):** Reflection — your speculative seed, including UX and difficulties.  
- **Assignment 2 (next):** Proposal — poking holes, testing assumptions, integrating new ideas.  
- **MTEC 3501 (this semester):** Ends with **design documents**, refined through iteration.  
- **MTEC 4501 (next semester):** Culmination Project, producing a prototype or completed work.  
- **Beyond:** The cycle continues across years or decades.  

👉 The **larger your vision**, the richer your iterations will be.

## 📌 Submission
- Create a shareable Google Doc, Dropbox file, or PDF.  
- Share it before Week 2 class.  
- Be ready to present orally during the brainstorming session, focusing on **UX, modality, and open questions**.  
- After feedback, refine this into **Version 2 (Speculative Proposal)** and later migrate it into your GitHub project folder.
