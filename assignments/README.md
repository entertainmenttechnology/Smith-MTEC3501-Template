# üìÇ MTEC 3501 ‚Äì Assignments

This folder contains weekly assignments for **MTEC 3501: Culmination Project Development**.  
Assignments are sequenced according to the **S‚ÄìR‚ÄìD‚ÄìM‚ÄìP‚ÄìA cycle**:  
Speculate ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Make ‚Üí Publish ‚Üí Assess.  

Each week builds toward your **end-of-semester prototype (Proof of Concept)** and prepares you for your Culmination Project (Least Viable Product in the following semester).
