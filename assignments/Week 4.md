### **Week 4 Assignment**

#### Activities: 
1. Continue to work on your detailed proposal.
2. Conduct precedent research on your developing idea.
3. Provide feedback for each other's projects.
4. Create issues and assign them to milestones as needed to design and plan for the mid-semester presentation.

#### More detailed Instructions:

1. **scaffolding out your detailed proposal**, in order to answer all the questions proposed by the Issue Card we filled out in class.  This card should be on your Project Board, and feel free to continue to expand on the card (you can edit the main part, and later you can add comments to it). In structions for how to access anfd fill out your Issue can be found in this document: [01-Filling Out Speculative Proposal](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/01-Filling_Out_Speculative_Proposal_issue.md)

2. Part of scaffolding is **conducting precedent research** for your project.  Instructions for this activity and how to integrate with the class system can be found in this [05-Precedent Research](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/05-Precedent%20Research.md)

3. You should also use the Project Feedback Issue to **comment on each other's proposals**:  you can do this by following the instructions in this document [03-Feedback on other Proposals](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/03-Feedback%20on%20Other%20Proposals.md)  

4. You are also going to **design your milestone activities** that need to be completed in order to have a successful presentation.  Deliverables for this presentation can be found in this document [02-Presentation Deliverables](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/02-Presentation_Deliverables.md).  You will create milestones and issues and place them into your project board.  Because the Boards are spplit into the five stages of a project, you can place issue cards appropriately (if it is a research project then under "research" column, etc.).  the detailes for the milestone project can be found in this document: [Structuring Milestones for Presentation](documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md).  We are working on tasks 1 [Issue Creation](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md#task-1-develop-a-set-of-issues-for-milestone-tracking-github-issues),  task 2 [Milestone selection or creation](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md#task-2-select-or-create-milestones-for-your-issues).  

5. For next week, be prepared to **present your set of issues and milestones** and how they are arranged on the project board.  We will then look at how to configure this into alternate views let us look at our tasks in different ways.  Of course, any issue you create that needs to be done in the following week should be done as well!  Keep working on building out your proposals, and make plans for each of the deliverables found in the document mentioned in teh previous paragraph.  

Next week will be in person:  see you in V103!  BUt also please please please get in touch with me if you have ANY questions!
