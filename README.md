## Class April 7
Good morning!  Today we meet on Zoom.  The focus of the remainder of the semester is to prep your projects for your presentations on **May 12**  You should read teh feedback, respond to the prompt in this [discussion](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/discussions/73).  Your evaluations can be found in your personal folders in this repository.  Today we continue to brainstorm, discuss and make suggestions about your project, and the deliverables that you need to provide as well.  

See you on Zoom!  The number is always the same but here it is again: 649-104-8253.  


## Week 8 Class
I was proud of everyone at last weeks presentartions! You were all well prepared, and though everyone still has questions, we are all on a good path to completion.  

Today is about receiving the faculty assessments, responding to these assessments, and then continuing to modify and develop your project.  Our next goal now it to identify what we will be demonstrating for the end of the semester: scope of the proof of concept, and then further refining our timeline to make sure that we are able to deliver appropriatey  

## **Week 6 Class**
Today we meet on Zoom.  We will first meet briefly as a class, to look at our plans for creating the necessary materials for our presentation on March 17 (Week 8).  
You should have a set of issues/milestones that will be needed to complete this phase of th eproject, and then I will split the class into individual sessions so you can show me where you are in your process, and I can provide some feedback.  Each person should receive about a half hour, and then we prep for next week, when we will do a mock run. Note that the next **TWO** classes will be in person.  We want to do our practice presentations in the same room using the same technology that we will use for the actual presentation, and we will all evaluate each other's presentations using the same forms that I will provide the jury.  

## **Week 5 Class**
This week is in person.  See you in V103!  We will also be sharing some materials via Zoom, so be prepared to demonstrate your project board and Management activity via that modality  

The Google Doc we are collaborating on can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sRqZ3h3i92Dw6U8cKZgi_KjgTbr03019x49mtbZEjRA/edit?usp=sharing)

### **Week 4 Assignment**

Due: 2025-02-24  

#### Activities: 
1. Continuing to work on your detailed proposal.
2. Conduct precedent research on your developing idea.
3. Provide feedback for each other's projects.
4. Create issues and assign them to milestones as needed to design and plan for the March 17 presentation.
5. Prepare to demonstrate your project board with issues and milestones for next week.

#### More detailed Instructions:

1. **scaffolding out your detailed proposal**, in order to answer all the questions proposed by the Issue Card we filled out in class.  This card should be on your Project Board, and feel free to continue to expand on the card (you can edit the main part, and later you can add comments to it). In structions for how to access anfd fill out your Issue can be found in this document: [01-Filling Out Speculative Proposal](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/01-Filling_Out_Speculative_Proposal_issue.md)

2. Part of scaffolding is **conducting precedent research** for your project.  Instructions for this activity and how to integrate with the class system can be found in this [05-Precedent Research](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/05-Precedent%20Research.md)

3. You should also use the Project Feedback Issue to **comment on each other's proposals**:  you can do this by following the instructions in this document [03-Feedback on other Proposals](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/03-Feedback%20on%20Other%20Proposals.md)  

4. You are also going to **design your milestone activities** that need to be completed in order to have a successful presentation.  Deliverables for this presentation can be found in this document [02-Presentation Deliverables](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/04_Detailed_Speculative_Proposal/02-Presentation_Deliverables.md).  You will create milestones and issues and place them into your project board.  Because the Boards are spplit into the five stages of a project, you can place issue cards appropriately (if it is a research project then under "research" column, etc.).  the detailes for the milestone project can be found in this document: [Structuring Milestones for Presentation](documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md).  We are working on tasks 1 [Issue Creation](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md#task-1-develop-a-set-of-issues-for-milestone-tracking-github-issues),  task 2 [Milestone selection or creation](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md#task-2-select-or-create-milestones-for-your-issues).  

5. For next week, be prepared to **present your set of issues and milestones** and how they are arranged on the project board.  We will then look at how to configure this into alternate views let us look at our tasks in different ways.  Of course, any issue you create that needs to be done in the following week should be done as well!  Keep working on building out your proposals, and make plans for each of the deliverables found in the document mentioned in teh previous paragraph.  

Next week will be in person:  see you in V103!  BUt also please please please get in touch with me if you have ANY questions!

**Week 3 Assignments**

There are two major thrusts for this week's assignments.

1. Create a Speculative detailed proposal.  This does not have to be accurate, it just needs to be DETAILED.  If you have quesitons, don't worry, just put something down.
Here is a link to the [Detailed Assignment](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Detailed-Speculative-Proposal.md).
2. Create Milestones and Issues for your upcoming presentation on March 10.  You will also populate your Project with milestones and issues that will be needed to be completed in order to meet the goal of the presentation. [Milestone Assignment](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md).  A file that describes [how to create a milestone](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/Create_A_Milestone.md) can be found as well.

I created an example proposal and placed it into David B. Student's folder. [Link](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/projects/David-Student/DBStudent-Clamorous%20ELF%20Detailed%20Speculative%20Proposal.md)  

Let me know if you have any questions!

This GitHub repository will manage and store activities within MTEC 3501.  Each student will have their own folder within which to place their documentation and products, and each student will also be assigned a Project in which we can manage your materials.  All research materials used as background will be placed into Zotero. The Wiki will hold additional information.
