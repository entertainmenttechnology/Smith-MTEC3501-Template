## 📝 Assignments

Assignments are released week by week and tied to the syllabus.
➡️ [Assignments Index (chronological)](documents-Class/assignments/README.md)

Key types of work you’ll complete:

* **Speculation & Brainstorming** → generate project seeds and scenarios.
* **Proposal Development** → detailed speculative proposal, precedent research, milestones.
* **Project Tracking** → GitHub Issues, milestones, and timelines.
* **Juried Presentation Prep** → proposal defense with professional panel.
* **Post-Presentation Analysis** → refine scope and planning based on feedback.
* **Proof-of-Concept Prototype** → an early working sketch of your project.

## 🧰 Project Management

We use **GitHub Projects (Kanban/Roadmap)** for task tracking:

* **Individual Projects**: Each student maintains a **personal Kanban board** in `/Projects/YourName`.
* **Group Projects**: Shared tasks go into the **Class Kanban Board**.
* Use **Issues + Milestones** for deliverables.
* Peer feedback is tracked with **issue comments** using the `Proposal_Feedback.yml` template.
