- What is currently missing, underdeveloped, or unsolved in this area?  
- Provide any relevant references or examples.  

---

## 3. Scope of the Study  
- What is the intended outcome (e.g., proof-of-concept, pilot experiment, prototype system, comparative study, artistic demonstration)?  
- What can realistically be achieved in an initial phase?  

---

## 4. Input / Source Material  
- What data, materials, or examples will be used?  
- In what form will they be collected or prepared?  
- How much material is needed for the study?  

---

## 5. Features / Parameters of Interest  
- Which aspects of the material or subject will be the focus?
