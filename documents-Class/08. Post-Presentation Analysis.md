**Due Date**: April 8 2005
**Course Week**: Week 8

Now that you've received expert feedback from your **midterm presentation** and submitted your **reflection**, it's time to **redefine your project trajectory** — for both the remainder of this semester **and** for your **Culmination Project (next semester)**.

This assignment will guide you in:
- Redesigning your project concept
- Defining your **Least Viable Product (LVP)** for next semester
- Planning your **Proof of Concept** for this semester
- Outlining how you will **present your deliverables**

---

## 🧩 Part 1: Revised Project Proposal

Update your original proposal based on feedback, reflection, and current thinking.

### ✳️ Required Elements:

- **Project Title**

- **Updated Concept Summary**  
  _1–2 paragraphs summarizing your current concept and core goals._

- **Least Viable Product (LVP) – Target for Culmination (Next Semester)**  
  Describe the **minimum complete version** you intend to create next semester.  
  Include:
  - What will the user experience?
  - What features must be complete for it to be “done”?
  - What technologies or platforms are involved?
  - How will you measure success?

> 🎯 _This is your draft plan for the Culmination Project._

- **Proof-of-Concept (This Semester)**  
  Define a **basic but functional** prototype or experiment you will complete this semester.  
  It should:
  - Focus on 1–2 key features or experiences
  - Demonstrate at least one technical or conceptual competency
  - Connect clearly to the LVP vision

- **AI Use Plan** (if applicable)  
  How will you use AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, image generators, code assistants)? Be specific.

- **Tools & Technologies**  
  List any software, frameworks, platforms, or hardware you plan to use.

## 🔧 Part 2: Deliverables & Milestone Plan

Plan the production steps that will lead to your **final presentation**.

### 📦 Deliverables (This Semester)

List all **outputs** you will produce for the final class. Examples:
- Proof-of-concept prototype
- Sample assets (art, sound, code, etc.)
- Technical documentation or diagrams
- Updated proposal with LVP clearly defined

### 📅 Milestones

Provide a **timeline or milestone list** for the next few weeks.  
You should include at least **3 major stages** (dates + goals).

Example:
```text
- Week 9: Complete UI sketches and basic interactions
- Week 10: Build prototype logic in Unity
- Week 12: User test with 2 peers and document findings
```
### 📽️ Final Presentation Strategy

Answer the following:

- What will you **show** during your final presentation?
- Will it be a **live demo**, **video walkthrough**, or **slide-based**?
- How will you explain the **connection between your proof-of-concept and your LVP**?
