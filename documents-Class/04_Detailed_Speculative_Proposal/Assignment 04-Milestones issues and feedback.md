# MTEC 3501 Assignment: Task Issues, Proposal Feedback, and Brainstorming  

## **Part 1: Build Out Your Task Issues with Milestones for the March 17 Presentation**  
Each student must ensure that their project is structured and organized in the shared **GitHub repository** by following these steps:  

### **1. Create and Update Your Task Issues**  
- Each student should create individual **task issues** in the repository within their **Project Folder**.  
- Each issue must include:  
  - **A clear task description**  
  - **Expected deliverables**  
  - **Dependencies** (if applicable)  
  - **Assigned branch** for development  

### **2. Assign Milestones Leading to the March 17 Presentation**  
- The **March 17 Presentation** is the primary milestone, but it is not yet an explicit milestone itself.  
- Instead, structure your **task issues** around key steps leading up to it.  
- Suggested milestone-related tasks:
  - **Draft Proposal Ready** ‚Äì Initial documentation of the project idea.
  - **Precedent Research & Analysis** ‚Äì Investigate related works, technologies, or artistic influences.
  - **Concept Visualization** ‚Äì Sketches, diagrams, mockups, or early wireframes.
  - **Prototype Planning** ‚Äì Outline of how the prototype will be developed beyond March 17.

## **Part 2: Continue to Develop Your Proposal**  
- Refine and expand on your **initial concept** based on research, feedback, and new insights.  
- Update your **project documentation** to reflect evolving ideas and directions.  
- Ensure that your **proposal remains clear and detailed** so it can be effectively communicated during the presentation.  

---

## **Part 3: Conduct Precedent Research**  
- Explore **existing projects, technologies, or artistic works** that relate to your idea.  
- Identify **patterns, structures, and solutions** that could inform your approach.  
- Document **how your project builds upon or differs from past works**.  
- Use research to **justify design choices and technical decisions** in your proposal.

## **Part 4: Provide Feedback on Other Projects (Using Proposal_Feedback.yml & Brainstorming)**  
Each student must engage in **peer review** by providing feedback on at least one other student‚Äôs proposal.  

### **1. Commenting on a Peer‚Äôs Board Using the `Proposal_Feedback.yml` Template**  
- Open the **Proposal Issue** of another student.  
- Use the structured feedback template from `Proposal_Feedback.yml`:  
  - **Strengths** ‚Äì What aspects of the proposal are well-developed?  
  - **Challenges** ‚Äì What areas need improvement?  
  - **Suggestions** ‚Äì Specific ways the project can be improved.  
  - **Brainstorming Ideas** ‚Äì Suggest alternative approaches, expansions, or integrations.  
    - Example prompts:  
      - *‚ÄúHow might this project scale into a larger interactive system?‚Äù*  
      - *‚ÄúCould AI or real-time data influence aspects of the experience?‚Äù*  
      - *‚ÄúAre there new storytelling or technical elements that could be added?‚Äù*  

### **2. Engage in Collaborative Discussion**  
- Ask **open-ended questions** to encourage further refinement.  
- Respond if the proposal author asks for clarification or builds on your ideas.
