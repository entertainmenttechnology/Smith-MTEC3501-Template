# **MTEC 3501 – Precedent Research Assignment**
Created 2025-02-19, David B Smith

## **Introduction: What is Precedent Research?**
As you transition from speculation into the design phase of your Culmination Presentation proposal, it is essential to ground your work in existing knowledge. **Precedent research** is the process of studying previous projects, technologies, and theoretical frameworks relevant to your work. By analyzing existing examples, you gain valuable insights into best practices, avoid common pitfalls, and build on established methodologies rather than reinventing the wheel. 

Precedent research helps refine your concept, ensuring that your project is informed by past innovations while positioning it within a broader creative and technical landscape. This step is particularly crucial at this stage, as it will help shape your design choices and strengthen the foundation of your prototype. 

For this assignment, you will conduct **precedent research**, document your findings in **Zotero**, and synthesize key insights into a **research summary** that will directly support your Culmination Presentation proposal.

## **Assignment Breakdown**

### **1. Learn about Precedent research**
   - Here is a reasonable article (["What is Precedetn Research and what can you Expect?"](https://neumannmonson.com/blog/precedent-research) that describes the value of precedent research, although in architecture.  It has universal apoplicability across all design disciplines.

### **2. Set Up Zotero**
   - Ensure you have a **Zotero account**. If you do not have one, create an account at [https://www.zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org).
   - Download and install:
     - **Zotero Desktop Application** ([Download here](https://www.zotero.org/download/))
     - **Zotero Connector** for your browser ([Get the extension](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors))
   - The **Zotero Connector** allows you to quickly save citations from websites, online articles, and digital libraries directly into Zotero.
   - Join the **MTEC 3501 Shared Zotero Library**: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/5864194/mtec-3501](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5864194/mtec-3501).
   - Confirm that you can **add citations** to the shared collection.

### **3. Conduct Your Research**
   - **Note: This is ongoing: you will continue to add to the research collection throughout teh semester and into the next ENT 4501 class!**
   - Identify at least **5 precedents** that relate to your project. These can include:
     - Similar projects in media, technology, or interactive design.
     - Research papers or academic articles on relevant topics.
     - Technical documentation of tools, software, or methods applicable to your project.
     - Artistic, theoretical, or cultural influences that shape your approach.
   - Each precedent must be accompanied by a brief **annotation (3-5 sentences)** explaining:
     - What it is.
     - How it relates to your project.
     - What insights you gain from it.

### **4. Document Sources in Zotero**
   - Use the **Zotero Connector** to save online sources directly.
   - Add all sources to **our shared Zotero collection** under an appropriate category.
   - Ensure each entry includes:
     - **Full citation information** (author, title, publication date, etc.).
     - **Tags** relevant to your project.
     - **Your annotation** in the "Notes" field.

### **5. Submit a Research Summary**
   - Write a **1-2 page summary** synthesizing your research findings. This should include:
     - A short **introduction** explaining your project and its focus.
     - A discussion of **key insights** gained from your research.
     - How this research informs your **design decisions** moving forward.
   - Format: Markdown or PDF.
   - Submit your summary via **GitHub** in your project's folder.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
| Criteria                     | Points |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Zotero Setup & Contribution  | 20     |
| Quality & Relevance of Sources | 30     |
| Annotations & Documentation  | 20     |
| Research Summary & Analysis  | 30     |
| **Total**                    | **100** |

## **Additional Notes**
- Zotero will be used **throughout the semester** for ongoing documentation.
- If you encounter technical difficulties with Zotero, reach out **before the deadline**.
- The research you gather now will directly support your **Culmination Presentation proposal** and subsequent development work.
