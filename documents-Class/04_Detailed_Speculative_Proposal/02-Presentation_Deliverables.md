# 📌 MTEC 3501: March 17 Project Proposal Presentation – Deliverables  

## **Overview**  
The **March 17 Presentation** serves as a critical checkpoint where students will complete the **Research/Design** phase via a juried **assessment** of the proposal's feasability and potential.  After integrating feedbacck from this presentation, you will then move into **early Production planning**. Students must clearly define their project vision, research findings, production milestones, and **what their end-of-semester proof of concept will be** (even though it will not be built yet).

## **📊 Structure for the 10-Minute Presentation**  

Each student should structure their **oral presentation** following this flow:  

### **🔹 1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)**  
- **Project Name & One-Sentence Summary**  
- **Project Type** (game, installation, animation, AI tool, etc.)  
- **Goal of the project** and why it is important  

### **🔹 2. Research & Precedents (2-3 minutes)**  
- **Key references, inspirations, and research findings**  
- **Technical or artistic precedents that inform the project**  
- **Personal past work** (if relevant) to show experience in this field  

### **🔹 3. Project Breakdown (3-4 minutes)**  
- **Climax Version:** Full, ambitious vision of the project  
- **Prototype Plan:** What the prototype will be, what it will demonstrate, and the first steps toward building it  
- **Technical requirements & tools needed**  
- **Expected challenges or uncertainties**  

### **🔹 4. Milestones & Feasibility (2 minutes)**  
- **Breakdown of key milestones in GitHub** (Research, Design, Produce, Publish, Assess)  
- **Estimated timeline and development strategy**  

### **🔹 5. Questions for Feedback (10 minute)**  
- Areas where **feedback is needed** to refine the project  
- Any **uncertainties about execution, scope, or research**  

📌 **Timing Tip:** Ensure the presentation stays under **10 minutes** to allow for panel feedback.
