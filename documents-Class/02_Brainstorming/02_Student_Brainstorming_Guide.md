# Student Guide: Brainstorming & GitHub Activities

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for students participating in brainstorming activities using GitHub.  We will be going through these basic activities in class, but you will then be assigned to continue your brainstorm and development in teh following week.

GitHub has its own highly developed users manuals and documentation.  This can be found [**here**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)

---

## **1. Getting Started with GitHub**
### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up, if you have not already created an account.
2. Verify your email and set up two-factor authentication (optional, but recommended).
3. Create a User Name that is easily related to your real name:  no "fancyNaMePoTaToMe365" etc.
   - If you already have a username that does not comply with this, then you can change your name for this repository only:
   - [here are instructions on how to do this on the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git)
   - You can also create a new user account, etc.
5. Provide this user name to the instructor

### **Step 2: Join the Class Repository**
1. You will receive an invitation link from your instructor.
2. Click the link and **accept the invitation** to join the repository.
3. Navigate to the class repository.

âœ… **Check:** Make sure you can access **Issues, Discussions, and the Wiki**.

### **Step 3: Creating a Branch, Folder, and Submitting a Pull Request**

âœ… **Goal:** Learn how to create a personal workspace in GitHub and merge changes back into the main repository.

#### **3.1: Create a New Branch**
1. Navigate to the **class repository** on GitHub.
2. Click the **Branches** dropdown next to the repository name.
3. Type your branch name in the format:  
   ```
   [your-name]-branch
   ```
   (e.g., `alex-smith-branch`).
4. Click **Create branch**.

#### **3.2: Create a Personal Folder**
1. Inside your branch, go to the repositoryâ€™s **File Explorer**.
2. Navigate to the `/projects/` directory.
3. Click **Add File** â†’ **Create new file**.
4. In the filename box, type:
   ```
   projects/[your-name]/placeholder.txt
   ```
   (This ensures your folder gets created: we will delete this file later once we have actual material in the folder).

#### **3.3: Upload Your Project Idea File**
1. Inside your personal folder (`/projects/[your-name]/`), create or upload a file:
   ```
   project_first_idea.md
   ```
2. Note that this file has a **.md** extension.  This is Markdown, a lightweight editor that can be used to format your documents.
   - [GitHub Markdown Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).  
4. In the document, include:
   - **Project Title**
   - **Description**
   - **Key Goals**
   - **Initial Brainstorming Notes**
5. Click **Commit changes**.

#### **3.4: Open a Pull Request (PR)**
1. Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab in the repository.
2. Click **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your branch (`[your-name]-branch`) as the **compare branch**.
4. Ensure the **base branch** is `main`.
5. Add a **title and description** for the PR.
6. Click **Create Pull Request**.
7. Wait for feedback from classmates and instructors before merging.

âœ… **Best Practice:** Always work on your **own branch** and submit a **Pull Request** to merge changes back to the main branch.
