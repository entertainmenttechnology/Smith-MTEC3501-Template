## **Student Brainstorming Activities Chart **

The following table outlines the activities students will complete, ensuring each introduces a different brainstorming method while also teaching a GitHub feature.

| **Activity** | **Brainstorming Goal** | **GitHub Feature Introduced** | **Student Tasks** |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Ensuring Access to Repository** | All students have access to repository | Student GitHub name created and registered | Create or provide a GitHub  User Name, as well as Discord. |
| **Setting Up Project Foundations** | Refine initial project idea and document it | Creating a branch, making a personal folder, uploading a file | Create a branch, add a folder `/projects/[student-name]/`, upload their refined project idea as a Markdown or text file, and open a Pull Request (PR) for feedback. |
| **Rapid Ideation** | Generate multiple variations of their project idea quickly | GitHub Issues (tracking ideas and iterations) | Create a GitHub Issue titled `[Student Name] – Brainstorming Starter`, list as many variations of their project idea as possible, review after 5 minutes, and pick the top three concepts. |
| **"Yes, And..." Expansion** | Expand and refine ideas collaboratively | Commenting on Issues (peer feedback) | Partner up and comment on each other’s brainstorming Issues, using "Yes, and..." to expand on their partner’s idea, providing new directions. |
| **Forced Juxtaposition** | Introduce unexpected elements into their project | GitHub Discussions (group brainstorming) | Instructor provides two random words for each student. Students create a Discussion Post linking their project to these words, and classmates reply with suggestions. |
| **"Kill Your Idea" Test** | Identify weaknesses and challenges in the project | Pull Requests (PRs) (submitting structured feedback) | Create a Markdown file `kill_my_idea.md` inside their project folder, list three reasons their project could fail and possible solutions, then submit it as a PR for peer feedback. |
| **Organizing Ideas with Miro** | Visually organize brainstorming insights | GitHub Wiki (documenting results) | Use Miro to visually map insights from previous activities, export the mind map, upload it to the GitHub Wiki, and provide a short summary explaining their revised project direction. |
| **Final Step: Review & Reflection** | Synthesize and refine their project direction | Merging branches, reviewing PRs | Review feedback from Issues, Discussions, and PRs, update their project document in their branch, and merge their branch into the main repository. |
