### COURSE DESCRIPTION  

Students dedicate three classroom hours and six independent study hours per week to begin the process of producing a capstone project, suitable for use as a portfolio item in applications for graduate school or professional employment. Projects may be undertaken individually or in small groups. Students develop their ideas, research prior art, break down proposed work into a sequence of executable components with estimated times-to-completion, iterate through prototypes, and document their work. This course is a prerequisite for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, in which students finalize and present the work begun in Culmination Project Development. Ideally, students will take the two courses consecutively, as this should be considered a single year long initiative that transcends the boundaries of the semester.

## COURSE STRUCTURE  
This course combines lecture/presentation, lab/studio, and discussion/critique. In preparation for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, you will move through iterative phases of project proposal development, including brainstorming, ideation, research, rapid prototyping, and presentation. 

You will receive robust feedback along the way from your peers, your course instructor, and additional faculty. At midterm, you will present your project proposal to a panel of faculty for feedback. At the end of the semester, you will present a prototype / proof of concept to a second panel of faculty, for additional feedback. Your are encouraged to also take advantage of faculty office hours, meeting with faculty who have expertise in particular areas of your project, for technical questions and further advisement. 

Weekly assignments will be posted to our GitHub wiki on Mondays, generally due the following Monday, to further assist your project development. This will consist of short readings and media viewings, reflections, and process documentation milestones. 

Note that our course will operate in hybrid modality, in a mix of in-person sessions and synchronous Zoom sessions. See our schedule below for the modality of each session.  


## GRADING   
**COURSE GRADING**     
Participation 20%    
Weekly assignments 25%     
Midterm proposal presentation and deliverables 25%   
Final presentation and deliverables 30%   
  
      
Participation will be graded out of 3 points:     
3 = full participation: fully present for class activity, on task, and supportive of classmates throughout the class session.   
2 = partial participation: late arrival or early departure from class activity, on task for some of the time.   
1 = minimal participation: absent from class activity for more than 30 minutes, minimally on task.    
0 = no participation.    
  
**Late policy:** Every effort must be made to turn work in on time, as it will otherwise put your project behind, while making it difficult or impossible for receiving adequate feedback. It will also impact your ability to fully engage in class activities and support your peers.  On a case by case basis, in consultation with the instructor, late deliverables may be accepted for a 10% drop in the grade for each week it is late. In certain extenuating circumstances (such as a serious emergency), the late deduction may be waved. If there is an emergency preventing your ability to work or present, please contact your professor. Panelist critiques, if missed, cannot be made up.      


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY
Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the College recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalogue.

_Instructor’s note:_ all borrowed text, code, or media used for this course must be attributed to the original creator, **whether human or AI**. Any direct text quotes from another source must be specified with quotes and appropriately cited. Code borrowed from another source at more than four lines in length must be attributed as a //comment within the code itself. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with your instructor before submitting. Any instance of plagiarism will be reported to the MTEC Program Director, Chair of ENT, and City Tech’s Academic Integrity Officer.     
  

## COURSE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES    
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the [Center for Student Accessibility](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/accessibility/). Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Center (phone: 718–260–5143). If you have already registered with the Center, please provide the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with your professor.  

## A NOTE ON CITY TECH'S COUNSELING CENTER     
The [Counseling Services Center](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/counseling/) supports the educational, emotional and career development of City Tech students by providing opportunities for skill development, counseling and referrals that address obstacles to success. The Center is currently available to students remotely and in person. For questions and appointments, contact the Center at counseling@citytech.cuny.edu or 718-260-5030.        

## INCLUSIVITY 
Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage 
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.    

Part II. Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Discord at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
