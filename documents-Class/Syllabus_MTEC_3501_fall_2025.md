### CATALOG COURSE DESCRIPTION

Students dedicate three classroom hours and six independent study hours per week to begin the process of producing a capstone project, suitable for use as a portfolio item in applications for graduate school or professional employment. Projects may be undertaken individually or in small groups. Students develop their ideas, research prior art, break down proposed work into a sequence of executable components with estimated times-to-completion, iterate through prototypes, and document their work.

This course is a prerequisite for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, in which students finalize and present the work begun in Culmination Project Development. Ideally, students take the two courses consecutively, as this should be considered a single year-long initiative that transcends the boundaries of the semester.

### **Detailed Description** 
This section of Culmination Preparation expands beyond the basics of project planning and content creation, and also  embeds **GitHub workflows**, the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework**, and **collaborative AI practices** into the development process. Students not only advance their culminating project proposals but also:

- Gain hands-on experience using **GitHub** for both **code development** and **project management** (issues, milestones, project boards).
- Develop **situational awareness** of how projects exist in **blended spaces** (physical, virtual, conceptual) using the BBS framework.
- Map project environments through **mediation pathways** (Source–Vector–Destination).
- Integrate **collaborative AI tools** for ideation, research, design, prototyping, and assessment while documenting their role transparently.
- Explore how individual work may connect to **CHI meta-projects** (such as Blended Shadow Puppet, UNESCO world-building, and BRPS). Participation in these larger initiatives is always **voluntary**—there is no pressure to do so—but the opportunity to link individual projects to broader interdisciplinary research may be especially rewarding.

By the end of the semester, students must **make** a **proof-of-concept prototype** and also **present/publish** their work: a 10-minute juried presentation, a well-organized GitHub repository, and supporting documentation.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

This set of outcomes is designed around the six stages of any project.  These are important parts of iterative design, and we will be seeing these stages at both micro and macro levels during this class.
| **Learning Outcome**                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Assessment Measure**                                                                               |

## COLLABORATIVE AI LEARNING OUTCOMES

Collaborative AI (CAI) is introduced in this course as part of the broader Balanced Blended Space Meta-Project, which emphasizes how Cognitive and Computational intelligences work together within Blended Space. Students explore AI as both a tool and an active collaborator in  each phase of the project

| **Collaborative AI Outcome**                                                                                                                                                                      | **Assessment Measure**                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Demonstrate the ability to treat AI as a **collaborative partner** in all phases of project development rather than as a passive tool.                                                            | Documentation of AI contributions in GitHub issues, commits, and reflections.                                |
| Experiment with **AI-assisted speculation**, expanding the scope of creative brainstorming and recording how AI ideas are accepted, modified, or rejected.                                        | Speculation logs and AI reflections uploaded to GitHub.                                                     |
| Conduct **AI-supported research**, including literature review, technical feasibility, and precedent analysis, while critically evaluating AI-suggested sources.                                  | Research summaries noting AI involvement and final curation decisions.                                       |
| Apply AI in **design documentation and prototyping**, testing how AI can accelerate workflows while remaining transparent about its limitations and the human role in oversight.                  | Iterative design files and mediation diagrams annotated with AI usage.                                       |
| Use AI during **production and documentation**, including scheduling, budgeting, and drafting artifacts, ensuring that AI outputs are critically reviewed and integrated with human decisions.    | Project documentation (timeline, budget, design) showing both AI draft and human-curated versions.           |
| Integrate AI into **presentation preparation**, such as brainstorming slide structures, drafting outlines, or practicing delivery feedback, while retaining human control over final expression. | Presentation materials with explicit notes on AI contribution and revision.                                  |
| Reflect on the evolving **ethics of human–AI collaboration**, especially within creative and scholarly contexts.                                                                                | Submission of final AI reflection essay as part of comprehensive documentation.                              |
