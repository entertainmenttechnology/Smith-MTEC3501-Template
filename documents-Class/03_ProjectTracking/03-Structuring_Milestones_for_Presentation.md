## **Objective**  
This week, you will **develop your project milestones** in preparation for your **March 17 presentation** to a **panel of professional jurists**, who will evaluate your proposal and make suggestions. The goal is to **formally structure your project ideas, develop a clear set of interrelated tasks, create documentation, and prepare for professional evaluation and feedback**.  

---

## **Task 1: Develop a Set of Issues for Milestone Tracking (GitHub Issues)**  
- You will **create GitHub Issues** that break down the key tasks leading up to your **March 17 presentation**.  
- Your issues should **map out the critical steps** needed to refine your proposal, research, and initial prototypes.  
- **Each issue should include:**  
  - A **clear title** describing the task.  
  - A **detailed description** of what needs to be completed.  
  - **Relevant labels** (e.g., “Research,” “Development,” “Documentation”).  
  - **Due dates** leading up to March 17.  
  - **Any references or links** to external resources.  

### 📌 Example Issues to Consider:  
1. **[Presentation Prep] Draft Initial Presentation Slides** – Outline the key points of my project presentation.  
2. **[Research] Identify Relevant Industry Examples** – Gather case studies and similar projects for reference.  
3. **[Design] Define Core Features** – List essential components that make this project unique.  
4. **[Feedback] Conduct Peer Review** – Share project draft with classmates for early feedback.  
5. **[Final Touch] Revise Presentation Based on Peer/Jurist Feedback** – Incorporate changes before March 17.  

✅ **Deliverable:** **Create a set of GitHub Issues** that represent the tasks needed to fulfill each **project milestone** required to complete the March 17 presentation.

## **Task 2: Select or Create Milestones for Your Issues**  
- Your GitHub issues should be assigned to the appropriate **milestones** in the **QuantumMusic Repository**.  
- **Some milestones may already exist**, while others may need to be created.

### **How to Assign an Issue to a Milestone**  
1. Open your **GitHub Issue**.
2. In the right-hand column, find the **“Milestone”** dropdown.
3. Select an appropriate milestone **(e.g., March 17 Presentation, Proposal Refinement, or Research Phase).**  
4. If no suitable milestone exists, create one by:
   - Navigating to the **“Milestones”** tab in the repository.
   - Clicking **“New Milestone”**.
   - Naming the milestone appropriately (e.g., “March 17 Presentation” or “Proposal Refinement”).
   - Setting a **due date** and **description** for the milestone.
   - Saving the milestone and assigning it to your issue.  

✅ **Deliverable:** Assign **each issue** to the most relevant milestone or create a new milestone if necessary.

## **Task 3: Develop a Detailed Proposal (Even If It’s Sketchy)**  
- This proposal will be the foundation of your **March 17 presentation**.  
- Even if you don’t have all the details finalized, you should outline:  
  - **Project Concept**: What is your project about?  
  - **Goals & Expected Outcomes**: What do you want to achieve?  
  - **Why It Matters**: How does this project contribute to your field?  
  - **Challenges & Questions**: What are the key uncertainties or areas you need feedback on?  

### 📌 Example Approaches for Writing Your Proposal:  
- **If your idea is well-defined:** → Write a traditional project proposal with a **clear roadmap and deliverables**.  
- **If you are still developing ideas:** → Create a **comparative outline** with multiple concepts and justify your chosen direction.  
- **If your project is exploratory:** → Define **research questions and experiment goals** rather than fixed deliverables.  

✅ **Deliverable:** **Submit a 2-page project proposal** outlining your concept and preparation for professional feedback.

## **Task 4: Scaffold Out Your README File**  
- Your **README.md** file should serve as the **project’s overview document**.  
- This will help you **present your project more clearly** during your March 10 presentation.  
- At a minimum, your README should include:  
  1. **Project Title**  
  2. **Description** – A brief summary of your project.  
  3. **How to Get Started** – Any tools, frameworks, or requirements.  
  4. **Milestones & Roadmap** – Your key tasks leading up to March 10.  
  5. **Resources & References** – Links to research, Zotero, and related materials.
