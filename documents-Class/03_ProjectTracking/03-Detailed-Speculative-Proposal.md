# **MTEC 3501: Detailed Speculative Proposal Assignment**
Dr. David B. Smith 
2025-02-11 creation date.

## **Objective**  
The purpose of this assignment is to **develop a detailed speculative proposal** that describes both an **idealized "Climax Version"** of your project and a **practical "Least Viable Product (LVP) Version"** that you can realistically build during this semester. The idealized version may likely be larger than what you can accomplish even with MTEC 4501.  The assignment is in two parts:  the proposal itself, and then your speculation on its strengths and weaknesses.  

This proposal is meant to be **detailed but not necessarily correct**â€”the goal is to **commit to specifics** even if they feel incorrect or you know they will change later. The act of defining clear ideas now will help you iterate, refine, and improve your project over time. 

Once complete, add this file to your GitHub folder in the "Projects" Directory.  Make sure to use your branch, and then we will merge during class.

### **Key Principles**
- **Specificity over Generality** â€“ A vague idea cannot be built. Be as detailed as possible.
- **Speculative, Not Final** â€“ You will revise your ideas as you progress.
- **Think Big, Then Scale Down** â€“ Define both a fully realized version of your project (**Climax Version**) and a simpler version that can be completed within a semester (**LVP Version**).
- **Momentum Over Perfection** â€“ This is about getting ideas down, not making them flawless. 
- **Self-Awareness** â€“ Identify what you know, what you assume, and what you need to research. 
- **If You Donâ€™t Know, MAKE SOMETHING UP!** â€“ The goal is **completeness, not correctness**. If you donâ€™t have an answer for a specific detail, create a plausible one for nowâ€”you can always adjust later. **DO NOT GET HUNG UP ON SPECIFICS.**

## **Assignment Structure**
Your speculative proposal should include the following sections:

### **1. Project Overview**  
- **Project Name**: A working title for your project.
- **One-Sentence Summary**: A concise description of what your project is.
- **Core Concept**: A brief but clear explanation of what your project is trying to achieve.

### **2. Climax Version (Fully Realized Project Vision)**  
Describe what your project would be in its **most complete, ambitious form**. If you had unlimited time, resources, and expertise, what would it become? This section should be written as if the project already exists.
- **User Experience**: Describe how an audience or user would interact with the project.
- **Technology & Systems**: Outline what tools, platforms, or AI/machine learning systems might be involved.
- **Creative Components**: Explain the artistic, narrative, or interactive elements of the project.
- **Expected Impact**: What does this project accomplish? Who is it for?

### **3. Least Viable Product (LVP) prototype Version (Achievable This Semester)**  
The **LVP is a stripped-down but functional version** of your project. It should preserve the **core essence of the Climax Version** but be simplified so that it can be built and tested within the semester.
- **Core Features**: The absolute minimum set of features needed to demonstrate the idea.
- **What It Can Do**: Define a simple, testable interaction or function.
- **What It Wonâ€™t Do (Yet)**: List the features or components that will be omitted for now.
- **Scalability Plan**: If this works, what are the logical next steps?

### **4. Research & Influences**  
- **Existing Projects & References**: List related works, inspirations, or technologies.
  - Since we have not yet started on precedent research, thi ssection may be limited, but you should at least list some inspirations or other projects that have influenced your choice.
- **What You Need to Learn**: Identify areas where research is required.

### **5. Self-Reflection & Open Questions**  
- **What Feels Strong?** â€“ What parts of your idea do you feel confident about?
- **What Feels Weak?** â€“ What assumptions are you making? What gaps exist?
- **What Needs Testing?** â€“ What unknowns can be tested with a prototype?

## **Frameworks for Different Project Types**  
Depending on your project focus, choose the most relevant framework to help structure your proposal.

### **ðŸ”¹ Interactive Media / Installations**
- **Climax Version:** A fully immersive environment where AI-generated visuals, sound, and audience input create an evolving performance or interactive experience.
- **LVP Version:** A single interactive element that responds to a userâ€™s input in real time.
- **Example Features:** Motion-tracking, generative sound, audience-contributed content.

### **ðŸ”¹ Game Development**
- **Climax Version:** A polished game with full mechanics, AI-driven elements, and multiplayer capabilities.
- **LVP Version:** A playable prototype with one or two core mechanics functioning.
- **Example Features:** Procedural generation, dynamic storytelling, AI-assisted gameplay.

### **ðŸ”¹ AI-Driven Tools / Systems**
- **Climax Version:** A sophisticated AI system capable of generating music, visuals, or interactive dialogue in response to complex inputs.
- **LVP Version:** A simple model trained on a small dataset to generate a basic output.
- **Example Features:** AI music composition, text-to-image generation, chatbot interaction.

### **ðŸ”¹ Narrative / Story-Driven Experiences**
- **Climax Version:** A multi-layered, branching interactive narrative with AI-generated elements.
- **LVP Version:** A single interactive scene or a text-based experience that showcases core themes.
- **Example Features:** Procedural storytelling, interactive world-building, generative text tools.

### **ðŸ”¹ Physical Computing / IoT Projects**
- **Climax Version:** A fully networked interactive system integrating sensors, AI, and dynamic feedback loops.
- **LVP Version:** A working prototype with basic sensor input and one form of responsive output.
- **Example Features:** Wearable tech, smart home automation, robotics.

### **ðŸ”¹ Video Production / Animation**
- **Climax Version:** A high-production-value animated short, documentary, or interactive film.
- **LVP Version:** A storyboarded sequence or a rough animatic demonstrating the core concept.
- **Example Features:** Motion capture, AI-assisted animation, generative video effects.

### **ðŸ”¹ Music Composition / Sound Design**
- **Climax Version:** A fully produced, multi-layered AI-assisted or generative musical composition.
- **LVP Version:** A short loop or proof-of-concept track demonstrating key ideas.
- **Example Features:** Algorithmic composition, live generative soundscapes, interactive music experiences.

## **Using Clamorous E.L.F. as an Exemplar**  
For a **detailed example** of how to structure your proposal, I put together a speculative proposal (Well, my avatar DavidBStudent did!)refer to [Clamorous E.L.F.](#), an AI-driven interactive media system that follows this same framework. This example demonstrates:
- A **Climax Version** that envisions a large-scale, fully realized interactive system.
- An **LVP Version** that identifies the most critical features to build first.
- Clear **technical and creative elements** that can be expanded or simplified.

You can use this as a **model** for structuring your own proposal!

## **Final Deliverables & Submission**  
âœ” **Detailed Speculative Proposal** (Written document following the structure above)  
âœ” **References & Research** (List of influences and key sources)  
âœ” **Self-Reflection Section** (Your own assessment of gaps, strengths, and uncertainties)  

---

### **Next Steps**  
This document is **not final**â€”it is a starting point. Your project **will change as you work on it**, and thatâ€™s expected. Use this proposal as a roadmap, and be ready to adapt as needed. 

ðŸš€ **Get your ideas down. Iterate later.**
